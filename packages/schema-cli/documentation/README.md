# Use Cases #

An organization's Cloud or Systems engineer is tasked with better tracking cloud-related assets per business unit; the engineer decides to employ tagging resources with five separate tags:

- Cost-Center
- Business Unit
- Organization
- Usage
- Compliance

`Cost Center` is one of the many integer-based IDs that stem from an internal financial auditing software.

`Business Unit` is an otherwise determinable department.

`Organization` is the company name.

`Usage` is an option available from a total of 5 different usage strings.

`Compliance` is a true or false assignment that the resource receives after each week after an internal auditing tool scans its tags.
